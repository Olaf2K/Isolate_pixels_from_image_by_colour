# Isolate_pixels_from_image_by_colour
This simple script isolates pixels based on a lower and upper treshold value in HSV colour space. The parameters are set in the script and can be adjusted to a scenario that fits.

The output is the number of pixels that fell in between the tresholds and a mask showing which pixels were counted.
